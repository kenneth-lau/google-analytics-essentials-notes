# Notes on Google Analytics Essential Training

## Terminology

- GA360 - enterprise version
- Google Tag Manager

## Get started

- Requirements
  - User must allow first party cookies
  - Every page must have embedded JS tracking code

## Fundamentals

- Properties and views
  - account > property > view
  - should have at property for each site or platform
  - views allow for different filters
  - at a minimum should have these views:
    - main reporting, testing, raw data
  
## UI and reports 

- "Insights" - tells you some interesting things about your data
- Reports
  - Audience - who's visiting the site?
  - Acquisition - how are users finding the site?
  - Behavior - user engagement
  - Conversion - if you've set goals
- Metrics and dimensions
  - Metrics
    - measures data
    - e.g. page views, sessions
  - Dimensions
    - qualitative
    - describes data in groups of that data
    - e.g. browser, device type
  - Scope
    - Levels: hit, session, user, product
    - metrics and dimensions should apply to same scope
  - Graph data over time
    - can overlay 2 different metrics for comparison
    - can compare 2 time periods with the same metric
    - can plot data for individual dimension (e.g. desktop and mobile)
  - Using annotations in metric reports
    - can be private (note for individual user) or shared
    - e.g. when filters are changed, notes about anomalies
  - Viewing data
    - Acquisition > Channels
      - can select two different metrics to compare
      - can also view using pivot table
      - there is a term cloud button

## Filter and segment data

- View filters
  - can be dangerous to use as it can filter out data from the views
- basic/quick inline filters
  - better to use the search bar to filter to get all instances
- advanced inline filter
  - can use reg expressions to search OR by using a pipe, "Matching RegExp"
    - e.g. to find traffic only from facebook or youtube: "facebook|youtube"
    - Acquisition > ALl traffic > source/medium
  - Can filter by primary dimension or also by metric
- Segmentation intro
  - intent
  - landing page
  - type of browser
  - mobile vs desktop
  - connection speed, screen resolution
  - can segment and subsegment
  - should think in terms of segments not all users as a whole
  - GA has presegmented reports and also customizable options
  - Can use secondary dimensions to combine multiple dimensions
  - Under "Channels", you can "Add segments"
    - Can then create your own segments
      - e.g. US male, age 25-34, Windows
      - can then compare segment against all users
  - What segments do we want?
  - - active users
  - lifetime
  - cohort
  - audiences
    - can create audiences
    - audience definitions
      - similar to segments but across other properties
  - user explorer
    - look into individual user behavior
  - Benchmark
    - to compare to other industry benchmarks
  - users flow
- Audience reports
  - overview
    - use date range comparison
    - not too much for analysis
  - demographics and interests
    - can break down by gender, age
    - can sort by different dimensions (e.g. conversion rate)
  - geographic location
    - can drill down by location
    - can break down by per user (e.g. per session value)
    - to see user engagement (e.g. session duration)
    - these metrics may not be reliable
  - technology
    - browser and OS
      - can use to surface browser compatibility issues
      - can use a "weighted sort" to filter out insignificant results
      - use this to optimize site for user needs
  - mobile
    - desktop, mobile, tablet
    - devices report
      - specific brands and devices
      - e.g. Apple vs Android
    - compare mobile vs desktop
  
- Acquisition reports
  - Overview
    - channels
  - All traffic
    - Channels
      - Q: Which channel/medium sends you the most traffic?
      - Q: Which channel is the most bang for buck?
      - organic search - i.e. Google search
      - paid search - sponsored search results
      - direct - user types in URL or lack of information
      - referral - user clicking on a link
      - social - social media sites
      - affiliates - affiliate marketing efforts
      - display - graphical ads (not search ads)
    - Source/Medium
      - identifies specific sources
      - answers "who is the source?"
    - Referrals
      - to see sites that refer to your site
      - add secondary dimension of landing page to see the page where users are coming to
    - Campaign tracking
      - to track by campaign name from same source and medium
      - works by using UTM parameters that are added to the URL
      - GA then uses this URL for tracking
      - hint: tag your campaigns (e.g. tweets) to get more granular data by building campaign URLs
  - Behavior
    - Q: How are your users engaging?
    - Overview
      - pageviews: user can view same page multiple times
      - unique pageviews: per session
      - bounce rate: when entire visit only had one page 
      - % exit: how many users are leaving the site from that page
    - Behavior flow
      - where are users dropping off?
      - useful if you have content groups
    - Site content
      - All pages
        - idea: click comparison button then select bounce rate to see problem areas by specific page
          - can then click that page and see how users got to that page
          - find pages with high bounce rates
      - Content drilldown
        - good for sites with deep structure and hierarchy
    - Site speed
      - measures load time and latency of pages
      - Q: what pages load the slowest?
        - we can then fix these first
      - Click "Technical" stats to get more details
      - Check load time of landing pages
        - Change primary dimension to landing page
      - Check load times by OS
        - e.g. Chrome OS vs Android
      - Check average load time over time range to look for anomalies
      - Also check map overlay to see if there are any issues in specific locations
      - speed suggestions
        - gives suggestions for how to improve speed
    - Events
      - any user behavior that you want to track
      - to add new events see Advanced course
        - need to add JS
        - use Google Tag Manager
        - Dev guide: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events
        - categorize events by category, action, label
      - event reports
    - Conversion reports
      - Overview
        - can configure 20 goals per view
        - need to configure goals to use this
        - can assign monetary value to goal
          - can also use goal conversion rate, not monetary/revenue
        - to find what segments/users are outperforming or underperforming
        - Goals
        - Goal URLs
          - to see the exact location where goal was completed
        - Reverse goal path
          - use this to find the path user took to achieve goal

        - funnel report
          - allows you to see where users abandoned the site or the funnel (set milestones)
      - Goal flow report
        - can drill down to specific parameters
        - see more details such as funnel exits
      - IDEAS for goals
        - anytime someone sees a product page
        - time on site
        - number of pages viewed
      - TODO: Must have goals configured and set up to make use of these reports
    - Real-time reports
      - see instantaneous results
      - could be important for sites with content that changes multiple times daily
      - can be useful to track interaction during promotions or campaigns
      - advanced tip: can use real-time API to publish this data
  - Basic configuration
    - 100 accounts, 50 properties, 25 views
    - In properties, can create audience definitions
    - In view section
      - TIP: set up goals here
    - can do user management at account/property/view level
  - IMPORTANT: Set up goals
    - View > Goal
      - can use templates for ideas
    - e.g. successfully complete contact us page, i.e. form completion
    - e.g. duration of 5 min or longer
    - e.g. pages per session
    - e.g. goals based on event interactions
    - if goal has clear steps, set up a funnel
    - if goal has a $ value, add value
